# Time Loop
## What is *Time Loop*?
Time Loop is a game project made by @Greggy.17 and me. The game was a part of *Brackey's Game Jam 2020.2* which gave every participant one week time to create a game around the theme *Rewind*. We started by brainstorming ideas. In the end we decided to roll with a house in which the main character time travels to get to the top of the building. The game is a platformer which tests player's reaction and memory. The goal is to get to the trophey on top of the building as fast as you can.
## How were the roles separated?
@Greggy.17 concentrated on music and assets while I took on the job of programming as well as helping out with creation of assets.
## Did we stop after the *Game Jam*?
Though it was our first ever *Game Jam*, we received positive feedback from other developers. So we kept on working and rolled out an update which includes bug fixes, optimizations, new decorations, better menu, wider access to the game and more.
## Which languages and game engines were used?
We used Unity and C# to create the game.
## Where can I play the game?
The game is available [here](https://inkuantum.itch.io/time-loop).
